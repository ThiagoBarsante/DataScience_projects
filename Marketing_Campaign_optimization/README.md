######  Summary and considerations

#### This project explains the concept of business intelligence and advanced analytics/prediction analysis. 
 These integration could provide even better business decisions and guide process improvement

##### All information, analysis, machine learning models and deployment considerations could be followed at bin/ directory and follow CRISP-DM methodology divided in phases
###### Phase 0 / kick off = Business requirement
###### Phase 1 = Exploratory data analysis (EDA) + Random Forest Regressor (python and sklearn) to plot feature importance
###### Phase 2 = +EDA + Build 3 machine learning models (GLM, RF and GBM) and choose the model with best performance for deployment
###### Phase 3 = Deployment options (Batch and Online Prediction)
