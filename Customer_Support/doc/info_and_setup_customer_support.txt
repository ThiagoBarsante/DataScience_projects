This project was developed using Jupyter Notebook (R and Python)



To run the project just download the public dataset from IBM website (local /data/) and run the notebooks .ipynb files


Resume of code and PDFs are availble in the bin/ directory
	.r and .py files are saved in specific directory for quick code view (exported from Jupyter)

	
** Phase 0 : Business requirement - starting point



** Phase 1 (python code): exploratory data analysis and 1 Machine Learning algorithm - Random Forest Classifier 
from scikit learn to start the investigation of feature importance

** Phase 2 (R code) we go deep in the feature analysis, get more insights from the data and execute 1 Machine Learning 
algorithm - XGBoost where we get 80% of accuracy

** In phase 3 we just summarize all the information and provide some deployment guidelines options to achieve the target 
of decrease churn rate



-------------
 INFO : the concept of telco customer churn can be applied to many business services based on customer loyalty
