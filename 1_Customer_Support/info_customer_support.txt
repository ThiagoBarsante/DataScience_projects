This project was developed using Jupyter Notebook (R and Python)

To run the project just download the public dataset from IBM website detailed in the code and run the .ipynb files

-> .r and .py files are saved in specific directory for quick code view (exported from Jupyter)

Resume of code and PDFs

** Phase 0 : Business requirement - starting point

** Phase 1 (python code): exploratory data analysis and 1 Machine Learning algorithm - Random Forest Classifier from scikit learn to start the investigation of feature importance

** Phase 2 (R code) we go deep in the feature analysis, get more insights from the data and execute 1 Machine Learning algorithm - XGBoost where we get 80% of accuracy

** In phase 3 we just summarize all the information and provide some deployment guidelines options to achieve the target of decrease churn rate

-------------
INFO: the concept of telco customer churn can be applied to many business services based on customer loyalty
